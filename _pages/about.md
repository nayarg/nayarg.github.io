Hi — I’m **Gowri Nayar**, a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University advised by **Russ Altman**.

My research develops **machine learning and network-based methods to understand protein function and pathways**, with a focus on the *understudied proteome*. I design graph neural networks, transformer models, and statistical benchmarks that translate large-scale proteomic and genomic data into biological insight.

Broadly, I’m interested in:
- Graph representation learning for biology  
- Protein function prediction  
- Foundation models for proteomics  
- Network algorithms for pathway discovery  
- Bridging ML methods with experimental validation  

I collaborate closely with experimental scientists to validate predictions through knock-out/knock-down studies and lead teams of students building state-of-the-art computational tools.

Before Stanford, I worked at **IBM Research** as an ML Team Lead, designing large-scale genomic analysis systems and applying NLP and deep learning methods to biological sequence modeling.
